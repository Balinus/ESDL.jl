So `celsiusCube = (kelvinCube - 273.15)` and `diffcube = abs(firstCube - secondCube)` would work as expected.\n\n## Applying custom functions\n\nThe main feature of this package, and probably the one one that is most different to other geospatial frameworks is the [`mapCube`](@ref) function that executes *arbitrary* functions on *arbitrary* slices (and permutations) of one or more input data cubes. The function can be written in Julia or call into C libraries, call other packages, etc. In addition, the computation will be carried out in a memory-efficient manner, such that  data is read only in chunks, processed and then re-written slice-by-slice to allow out-of-core computation. The basic working principles are:\n\n1. The user-defined function (UDF) `f` takes a number `N_in` of arrays as input and its output is represented in a number `N_out` of output arrays.\n2. The function `f` has at least `N_out + N_in` arguments, where so its signature is `f(xout1, xout2, .... ,xoutN, xin1, xin2, ... xinN, addargs...; kwargs...)`\n3. Every input array of `f` will be a slice of an input data cube. The user specifies the axes that will be used for slicing by creating an [`InDims`](@ref) object for every input cube object and passing it to the [`mapCube`](@ref) function.\n4. The dimensions of every output array have to be specified by the user by creating an [`OutDims`](@ref) object for every output cube and passing it to the [`mapCube`](@ref) function.\n5. The input data cubes may have additional dimensions which are not used for slicing, these will be iterated over and the function `f` will be called repeatedly for every slice. If there are multiple input cubes, and contain additional axes of the same name, they are required to have the same axis elements, so that these elements are matched in the loop. If different input cubes have differently named additional axes, their oputer product will be applied and the axes will all be added to the output cubes.\n\n### A minimal example\n\nIn order to understand how these principles are applied, let us walk through a very basic example, namely a function that normalizes the time series of a data cube. This means, we want to scale each time series in the cube in a way so its mean will be 0 and its standard deviation will be 1. To translate this into the principles mentioned above:\n1. Our function that we want to writes will take a 1D-array as an input (a time series) and write an output of the same length.\n2. So the function will have to accept two arguments, which will be called `xin` for the input time series and `xout` for the output time series. Such a function can be defined like this:\n","category":"page"},{"location":"analysis/#","page":"Analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"@example 1 using ESDL","category":"page"},{"location":"analysis/#","page":"Analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"function mynorm(xout, xin)","category":"page"},{"location":"analysis/#","page":"Analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"m = mean(skipmissing(xin))\ns = std(skipmissing(xin))\n\nif s > 0 # std non-zero\n    xout[:].=(xin.-m)./s # elementwise calculation of normalized values\nelse # time series is probably constant\n    xout[:]=0\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"analysis/#","page":"Analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"end","category":"page"},{"location":"analysis/#","page":"Analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"\nNext we have to define the input dimensions for our data cube.

The problem is, that mean and standard deviation are scalars while the time series is a vector so they can not easily be coerced into a single output cube.
